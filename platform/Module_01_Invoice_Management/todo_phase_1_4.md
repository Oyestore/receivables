# To-Do List: Phase 1.4 - Advanced UI Components Implementation

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-05-10

## 1. Planning & Design

-   [X] Create `todo_phase_1_4.md` (this file).
-   [X] Create `phase_1_4_advanced_ui_design.md` detailing UI/UX for:
    -   [X] Conditional Logic Builder (visual interface for defining rules).
    -   [X] User-Defined Data Source Management UI (interface for connecting/managing custom data sources).
    -   [X] Template Version History Browser (UI for viewing, comparing, and reverting template versions).
-   [ ] Review and get user approval for `phase_1_4_advanced_ui_design.md`.

## 2. Frontend Development (GrapesJS Plugins/Components)

-   [ ] Implement the Conditional Logic Builder as a GrapesJS plugin/custom panel.
    -   [ ] Develop UI elements (dropdowns, input fields, rule groups).
    -   [ ] Implement logic to store/retrieve conditional rules with template components.
-   [ ] Implement the User-Defined Data Source Management UI.
    -   [ ] Develop forms for data source configuration.
    -   [ ] Implement logic to interact with backend for managing these sources (conceptual backend interaction).
-   [ ] Implement the Template Version History Browser UI panel.
    -   [ ] Develop UI to display version list (timestamps, comments).
    -   [ ] Implement functionality to call backend for version history.
    -   [ ] Implement functionality to load/preview selected older versions in the editor.
    -   [ ] Implement functionality to revert to a selected version (triggering backend save).

## 3. Integration & Testing

-   [ ] Integrate new UI components with the existing GrapesJS editor and backend APIs.
-   [ ] Create `test_plan_phase_1_4.md`.
-   [ ] Conduct thorough frontend testing of all new UI components:
    -   [ ] Test functionality of the Conditional Logic Builder.
    -   [ ] Test functionality of the Data Source Management UI.
    -   [ ] Test functionality of the Version History Browser.
    -   [ ] Test usability and interactivity of all new UI components.
    -   [ ] Test browser compatibility.
-   [ ] Test error handling for new UI features.

## 4. Documentation

-   [ ] Update user guides with instructions for using the new advanced UI components.
-   [ ] Update technical documentation (design documents, GrapesJS plugin details).

## 5. Reporting & Deliverables

-   [ ] Update `todo_phase_1_4.md` with completed tasks.
-   [ ] Report completion of Phase 1.4 and provide all deliverables to the user.
-   [ ] Consider this the completion of the overall "Phase 1" of the Smart Invoice Generation module.
