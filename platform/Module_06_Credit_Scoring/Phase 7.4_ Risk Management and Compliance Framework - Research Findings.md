# Phase 7.4: Risk Management and Compliance Framework - Research Findings

## Risk Management Framework Fundamentals

### Core Components of Risk Management Framework (RMF)

Based on industry standards and best practices, a comprehensive risk management framework consists of five key components:

1. **Risk Identification**
   - Define the risk universe (all possible risks)
   - Categorize risks: operational, regulatory, legal, political, strategic, IT, credit
   - Distinguish between core risks (essential for business) and non-core risks (can be minimized/eliminated)

2. **Risk Measurement and Assessment**
   - Quantify specific risk exposures and aggregate risk exposure
   - Calculate probability of loss occurrence
   - Consider diversification benefits and overall risk profile impact
   - Use measures like Value at Risk (VaR), Earnings at Risk (EaR), Economic Capital
   - Apply scenario analysis and stress testing

3. **Risk Mitigation**
   - Eliminate or minimize identified risks
   - Methods: asset/liability sales, insurance, hedging with derivatives, diversification
   - Balance between risk retention and mitigation based on business needs

4. **Risk Reporting and Monitoring**
   - Regular reporting on specific and aggregate risk measures
   - Ensure risk remains at acceptable levels
   - Frequency varies by industry (daily for financial institutions, less frequent for others)
   - Reports must reach personnel with authority to adjust risk exposures

5. **Risk Governance**
   - Ensure all employees perform duties in accordance with risk management framework
   - Define roles and responsibilities for all employees
   - Segregate duties and assign authority for risk decisions
   - Board oversight and approval processes for core risks and limits
