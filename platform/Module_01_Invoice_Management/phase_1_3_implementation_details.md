Continuing with Phase 1.3 implementation.

1.  **Template Data Representation:**
    *   The template data will be stored in a structured format, likely JSON, that represents the components and their properties.
    *   This format needs to be flexible enough to accommodate various template structures and content types.

2.  **Visual Editor Implementation:**
    *   The editor will provide a drag-and-drop interface for users to manipulate template components.
    *   It will allow users to add, remove, and reorder components, as well as edit their properties.
    *   The editor will provide a real-time preview of the template as it is being edited.

3.  **Backend Integration:**
    *   The editor will communicate with the backend to load and save template data.
    *   The backend will be responsible for validating the template data and ensuring that it is well-formed.

4.  **User Experience:**
    *   The editor should be intuitive and easy to use, even for users with no prior experience with template editors.
    *   It should provide clear feedback to users about their actions and the state of the template.

5.  **Error Handling:**
    *   The editor should gracefully handle errors and provide helpful messages to users.
    *   It should also prevent users from making invalid changes to the template.

By addressing these points, I can ensure that the visual template editor is a powerful and user-friendly tool for creating and managing templates.
