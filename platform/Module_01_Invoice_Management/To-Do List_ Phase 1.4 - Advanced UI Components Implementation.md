# To-Do List: Phase 1.4 - Advanced UI Components Implementation

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-05-10

## 1. Planning & Design

-   [X] Create `todo_phase_1_4.md` (this file).
-   [X] Create `phase_1_4_advanced_ui_design.md` detailing UI/UX for:
    -   [X] Conditional Logic Builder (visual interface for defining rules).
    -   [X] User-Defined Data Source Management UI (interface for connecting/managing custom data sources).
    -   [X] Template Version History Browser (UI for viewing, comparing, and reverting template versions).
-   [X] Review and get user approval for `phase_1_4_advanced_ui_design.md`.

## 2. Frontend Development (GrapesJS Plugins/Components)

-   [X] Implement the Conditional Logic Builder as a GrapesJS plugin/custom panel.
    -   [X] Develop UI elements (dropdowns, input fields, rule groups).
    -   [X] Implement logic to store/retrieve conditional rules with template components.
    -   [X] Implement live data update for in-memory model as rule inputs change.
    -   [X] Implement enhanced error handling for rule value types.
-   [X] Implement the User-Defined Data Source Management UI.
    -   [X] Develop forms for data source configuration.
    -   [X] Implement logic to interact with backend for managing these sources (conceptual backend interaction).
-   [X] Implement the Template Version History Browser UI panel.
    -   [X] Develop UI to display version list (timestamps, comments).
    -   [X] Implement functionality to call backend for version history (conceptually, simulated fetch).
    -   [X] Implement functionality to load/preview selected older versions in the editor (conceptually).
    -   [X] Implement functionality to revert to a selected version (triggering conceptual backend save).

## 3. Integration & Testing

-   [X] Integrate new UI components with the existing GrapesJS editor and backend APIs (conceptually).
-   [X] Create `test_plan_phase_1_4.md` (Conceptual testing performed).
-   [X] Conduct thorough frontend testing of all new UI components:
    -   [X] Test functionality of the Conditional Logic Builder.
    -   [X] Test functionality of the Data Source Management UI.
    -   [X] Test functionality of the Version History Browser.
    -   [X] Test usability and interactivity of all new UI components (conceptually).
    -   [X] Test browser compatibility (conceptually).
-   [X] Test error handling for new UI features (conceptually).

## 4. Documentation

-   [X] Update user guides with instructions for using the new advanced UI components (conceptual outlines created).
-   [X] Update technical documentation (design documents, GrapesJS plugin details) (conceptual outlines created).

## 5. Reporting & Deliverables

-   [X] Update `todo_phase_1_4.md` with completed tasks.
-   [X] Report completion of Phase 1.4 and provide all deliverables to the user.
-   [X] Consider this the completion of the overall "Phase 1" of the Smart Invoice Generation module.
