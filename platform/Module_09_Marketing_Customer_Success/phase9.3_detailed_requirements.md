#### Integration Testing Specifications

Integration testing will validate data flow and functional integration between analytical components, platform modules, and external systems with comprehensive end-to-end workflow validation and error handling verification.

```python
# Example Integration Test Specifications
import pytest
import asyncio
from httpx import AsyncClient
from analytics.api import app
from analytics.database import get_database_session
from analytics.external_integrations import CRMIntegration

class TestAnalyticsAPIIntegration:
    """Integration tests for analytics API endpoints"""
    
    @pytest.fixture
    async def client(self):
        async with AsyncClient(app=app, base_url="http://test") as client:
            yield client
    
    @pytest.fixture
    def auth_headers(self):
        return {"Authorization": "Bearer test-jwt-token"}
    
    async def test_customer_behavior_analysis_endpoint(self, client, auth_headers):
        """Test complete customer behavior analysis workflow"""
        customer_id = "test-customer-123"
        response = await client.get(
            f"/api/v1/analytics/customers/{customer_id}/behavior",

```

#### Performance Testing Specifications

Performance testing will validate system performance under various load conditions including concurrent user access, large data volumes, and complex analytical workloads with specific performance targets and scalability validation.

```python
# Example Performance Test Specifications
import asyncio
import time
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
from analytics.performance_testing import PerformanceTestRunner

class TestAnalyticsPerformance:
    """Performance tests for analytics capabilities"""
    
    def setup_method(self):

    async def test_dashboard_loading_performance(self):
        """Test dashboard loading performance under load"""
        # Simulate 100 concurrent dashboard loads
        async def load_dashboard():
            start_time = time.time()
            # Simulate dashboard data loading
            await self.test_runner.load_customer_dashboard('test-customer')
            return time.time() - start_time
        
        tasks = [load_dashboard() for _ in range(100)]
        load_times = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        
        # Validate performance requirements
        avg_load_time = sum(load_times) / len(load_times)
        p95_load_time = sorted(load_times)[int(0.95 * len(load_times))]
        
        assert avg_load_time < 2.0  # Average load time under 2 seconds
        assert p95_load_time < 5.0  # 95th percentile under 5 seconds
    
    async def test_analytical_query_performance(self):
        """Test analytical query performance with large datasets"""
        # Test query performance with 1M+ customer records
        start_time = time.time()
        result = await self.test_runner.execute_complex_analytics_query(
            customer_count=1000000,
            time_range_days=365
        )
        query_time = time.time() - start_time
        
        assert query_time < 10.0  # Complex queries under 10 seconds
        assert result['record_count'] > 0
    
    def test_concurrent_user_scalability(self):
        """Test system performance with concurrent users"""
        def simulate_user_session():
            # Simulate typical user analytics session
            return self.test_runner.simulate_user_analytics_session()
        
        with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1000) as executor:
            futures = [executor.submit(simulate_user_session) for _ in range(1000)]
            results = [future.result() for future in futures]
        
        # Validate that all sessions completed successfully
        success_rate = sum(1 for result in results if result['success']) / len(results)
        assert success_rate >= 0.95  # 95% success rate under load
```
