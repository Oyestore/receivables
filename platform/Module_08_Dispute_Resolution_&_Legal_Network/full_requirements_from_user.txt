Requirements Document: Multi-Agent Platform for Receivables Management in Indian SME Sector
1. Executive Summary
This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive multi-agent platform designed to address the receivables management challenges faced by Indian SMEs. The platform leverages artificial intelligence, machine learning, and interconnected agents to create an end-to-end solution that manages the entire receivables lifecycle - from invoice creation to payment collection and dispute resolution. The solution aims to tackle the Rs. 10.7 lakh crore delayed payment problem affecting Indian MSMEs by creating a transparent ecosystem that encourages timely payments through a combination of incentives, penalties, automation, and data-driven insights. To optimize their invoicing and accounts receivable (AR) processes and ensure timely payments and healthy cash flow, businesses can implement several effective strategies. These strategies encompass various aspects of the process, from setting clear terms upfront to diligently following up on overdue payments and leveraging technology.
